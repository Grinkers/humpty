//! Provides heartbeat (ping/pong) configuration utilities.

use std::time::Duration;

/// Represents heartbeat configuration.
///
/// A heartbeat, also known as a ping/pong, is a mechanism that allows the server to ensure that the
///   client is still connected and functioning properly. If enabled, the server will send a small message
///   to the client every `interval` seconds. If the client does not respond to any pings within
///   `timeout` seconds, the server will close the connection and run the configured callbacks.
///
/// You can learn more about heartbeats on the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers#pings_and_pongs_the_heartbeat_of_websockets).
